# CISC881FinalProject
The final code submitted in association with my CISC 881 final project.
The whole codebase has been compressed down to 2 jupyter files:

1. **Central_Line_UNet**
This file contains the code that preprocesses data for, builds, trains and tests the U-Net.

2. **CentralLine_Classifier**
This file contains the code that preprocesses data for, builds, trains and tests the classifier.

Note that, for both notebooks, outputs have been conserved to show the function and performance of each section.

Beyond python packages installed to support this project, the only other source of code was the [SlicerIGT/aigt repo](https://github.com/SlicerIGT/aigt).
